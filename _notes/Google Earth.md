## Google Earth üåè
Sometimes I love roaming around places in 3D view on Google Earth. I've visited and spent some time on many places. They were really beautiful. I long to visit those places again. I remember them so deeply and have feel in love with them. 

There's always a vague memeory of having been in those places. I really want to go back, but I never can. I have no record of what those plalces are. It was somewhere in antartica. A house made out of wood. Warm and cozy. Clean and perfect. Then there was this island where people who lived had made amazing houses and things out of dried hay. 

I want to record both the amazing locations and experiences from now.
