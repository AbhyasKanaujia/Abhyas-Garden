I love reading. I haven't got time for it these days, but I really do.

I also love writing. I'm loving this garden that I am creating for myself where I can let my thoughts flow. I used to have this fixed routine every night before sleep of writing in my diary. I hope I'll get back to that habit through this garden.

## Interests
[[Exploration]] 
I get a feeling I should not do this right now as this a huge world and I don't have time for this right now. I need to focus on my placement right now and  later when I have time aftr my placements I'll continute this.
