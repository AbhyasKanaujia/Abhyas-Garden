## Google Earth üåè
Sometimes I love roaming around places in 3D view on Google Earth. I've visited and spent some time on many places. They were really beautiful. I long to visit those places again. I remember them so deeply and have fell in love with them. 

There's always a vague memeory of having been in those places. I really want to go back, but I never can. I have no record of where those plalces are. 

One of them was somewhere in Antartica. A house made out of wood. Warm and cozy. Clean and perfect. Then there was this island where people who lived had made amazing houses and things out of dried hay. 

I want to record both the incredible locations and experiences from now.
## Explore all coutries by name?
I remember having this idea once a few years back when I wanted to explore the [[music ]] and [[movies]] of various countires in the work. Mix this with my desire to travel the world through Google Earth, how about spending each week [[explore world online |exploring music/movies/culture/food/Google Eath of all the countries in alphabetial order]]? Ofcouse I'll do it online becuase actually travelling is expensive and too much to do for my introverted self. 

So I Googled the list of countries in the world, and maybe this is the start of [[explore world online|a new journey]].
